# Paper: A Fourier Perspective on Model Robustness in Computer Vision

## Main insights

- Gaussian data augmentation and adversarial training bias models towards low
  frequency information
- Fourier perspective is not predictive in all situations of transfer between
  data augmentation and robustness.
- More varied data augmentation offers more general robustness
- Adversarial examples are not strictly a high frequency phenomenon
